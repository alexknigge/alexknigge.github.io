I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of New Mexico. My main focus is High-Performance Computing, specifically in *green* HPC. In addition to my academics, I am the team manager of the UNM HPC team, an R&D Intern at Sandia National Laboratories, a research assistant in the UNM Scalable Systems Laboratory, and the teaching assistant for the UNM 4/591 HPC course. Outside of school I love to travel (I've visited 5 continents!), gaming, and anything in the outdoors.
